Component Types 

Two Types of Component -> 1.Stateless Functional Component -> JS Functional -> return that describe UI s
                          2.Stateful Class Component -> Class extending Component class
                                                        Render method return HTML e.g class welcome extends React.Component { Render()}

Components describe a part of the UI. They are re-usable and can also be nested inside another Component as well.

Functional Components

optional object of properties (props) => JS function => JSX

exporting => exporting defaults will give you the rights to change the name where you implement that component.
             export => you had to import the name with the same name! also had to include the curly brackets for e.g { name }

Class Components

optional receives (props) => es6 => JSX

it can maintain ... private state => only information to the current component

Functional Component vs Class Component

Functional
-simple function
-use func component as much as possible
-absence 'this' keyword
-solution without using state
-Mainly responsible for the UI
-called Stateless/Dumb/Presentational

Class

-More feature rich 
-Maintain their own private data -state
-Complex UI Logic
-Provide lifecycle hooks
-Stateful, Smart/ Container

JSX
-JavaScript XML (JSX) - Extension to the JS language syntax.
-Write XML-like code for elements and components.
-JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.
-JSX is not a necessity to write React applications.
-JSX makes your react code simpler and elegant.
-JSX ultimately transpiled to pure JS which is understood by the browsers.
